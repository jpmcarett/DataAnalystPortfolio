Housing Project - Nashville Dataset

Overview
This project focuses on cleaning and organizing a housing dataset for Nashville. The dataset initially posed challenges due to inconsistencies, 
missing values, and redundant information. The goal was to transform the raw data into a clean and structured format ready for analysis and further use.

Data Cleaning Process

Address Standardization
The property addresses in the initial dataset exhibited inconsistencies. Address standardization techniques were applied to break down the addresses into individual components such as Address, City, and State.

Owner Address Parsing
The OwnerAddress field presented challenges, containing multiple values separated by commas. Parsing techniques were applied to split the OwnerAddress into individual components, including Address, City, and State.

Removing Duplicates
To ensure data accuracy, duplicate records were identified and removed based on specific columns such as ParcelID, PropertyAddress, SalePrice, SaleDate, and LegalReference.

Conclusion
This data cleaning process resulted in a more organized and reliable dataset for housing information in Nashville. The cleaned data is now suitable for various analytical tasks and can serve as a foundation for further exploration and insights.
